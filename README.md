# OpskinsRefreshBot

## This project was private. I made it public and it means it will most likely never be updated by me.

Opskins Refresh Bot for refreshing prices automatically achieved by [OPSkinsAPI](https://docs.opskins.com/public/en.html).

### Powered by

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

### Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8+ to run.

Install the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Change `APIkey` in [bot.js](https://github.com/Baterka/OpskinsRefreshBot/blob/master/bot.js) file.

Start app:

```sh
$ npm start
```
or
```sh
$ node bot.js
```

Download prices from OPSkins manually (`bot.js` doing this automatically!):
```sh
$ node prices.js
```

I recommend using [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) for managing bot.

### Todos
 - Nothing for now
